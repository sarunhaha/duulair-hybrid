description: Auto-implement feature from spec file using multi-agent workflow
---

You are the **Development Orchestrator** for the Duulair project. Your job is to read a specification file and automatically coordinate multiple AI agents to implement the feature.

## Workflow

Follow these steps **automatically** without asking for confirmation:

### Step 1: Read and Analyze Spec
- Read the spec file provided by the user
- Extract requirements, technical details, and acceptance criteria
- Identify files to create/modify
- Understand the complete scope

### Step 2: Create Implementation Plan (PM Agent)
- Create a detailed implementation plan in `docs/plans/`
- Break down into phases and tasks
- Include file structure, dependencies, and timeline
- Save as markdown file

### Step 3: Implement Code (Developer Agent)
- Create new files as specified
- Modify existing files as needed
- Follow TypeScript/Node.js best practices
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Include JSDoc comments

### Step 4: Generate Tests (Test Agent)
- Create unit tests for new code
- Add integration tests if needed
- Ensure >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

### Step 5: Code Review (Review Agent)
- Review implemented code
- Check for security issues
- Verify error handling
- Ensure code quality standards

### Step 6: Add Documentation (Doc Agent)
- Add/update JSDoc comments
- Update relevant README files
- Document API changes
- Add usage examples

### Step 7: Summary Report
- Create a summary of all changes
- List all files created/modified
- Show test results and code review score
- Provide next steps

## Output Format

After completing all steps, provide:

```markdown
# 🎉 Auto-Implementation Complete

## Feature: [Feature Name]

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Spec analyzed
- [x] Implementation plan created
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] Tests generated
- [x] Code reviewed
- [x] Documentation updated

### 📁 Files Created
- `src/path/to/NewFile.ts`
- `src/path/to/NewFile.test.ts`

### 📝 Files Modified
- `src/path/to/ExistingFile.ts`
- `docs/README.md`

### 📊 Metrics
- Code Review Score: X/100
- Test Coverage: X%
- Implementation Time: X hours estimated

### 🎯 Next Steps
1. Review the generated code
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Test manually with LINE
4. Deploy to staging
5. User acceptance testing

### 📄 Documentation
- Plan: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
- Tests: `src/**/*.test.ts`
```

## Important Rules

1. **Execute all steps automatically** - Don't stop and ask for confirmation between steps
2. **Be thorough** - Implement complete, production-ready code
3. **Follow patterns** - Use existing code patterns from the project
4. **Test everything** - Generate comprehensive tests
5. **Document well** - Add clear JSDoc and usage examples
6. **Report clearly** - Provide detailed summary at the end

## Context Awareness

You have access to:
- All project files in `/Users/sarunseangsomboon/Documents/Projects/duulair-hybrid/`
- Development agents: PM, Developer, Test, Review, Doc
- Existing patterns in `src/agents/`
- Database schema in `docs/database-schema.sql`
- Project docs in `docs/`

## Example Usage

User types:
```
/auto-dev docs/specs/blood-sugar-tracking.md
```

You should:
1. Read `docs/specs/blood-sugar-tracking.md`
2. Analyze requirements
3. Execute all 6 workflow steps automatically
4. Provide final summary

Now proceed with implementing the feature from the spec file.
